    "The geometric model of a robot is a set of equations describing the robot's geometry. This enables for instance to calculate the end-effector's position in the workspace based on the joint angles. There are 2 kinds of geometric models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Direct Geometric Model (DGM) : given joint positions, it gives the position of the end-effector (tool, hand, foot, etc.) with respect to the robot's base \n",

    "The joint positions are typically denoted by $q$ and belong to __joint space__, whereas the end-effector's pose, typically denoted $p$, belongs to the __task space__ (or cartesian space). So the geometric model is in fact a mapping between the joint space and the task space. We will introduce these concepts more concretely with examples. "
