    "In order to execute some desired motion, we need to tell each actuator which contribution it should bring to the overall joint space motion. The commands ultimately sent to the robot's actuators are the typically motor currents (eletrical actuation) or pistons fluid pressure (hydraulic actuation). But on a higher level, what causes these motion are forces and torques output by the actuators, regardless of how they internally function. So for now, we will disgard the low-level actuation process and assume \"ideal\" actuators than generate directly a force or a torque when commanded so.   \n",
