    "To understand the equation of motion, we will draw on the example of pushing a car on a flat street without incline. Let's assume the car has a mass of 1000 kg. The question we want to answer is this: When we push the car, how will it move?\n",
    "\n",
    "When we push the car continously, we apply a force $F$ on the car. In the following we will look at the motion of the car in 1D. I assume you have heard the terms __velocity__ $v$ (the speed of the car) and __acceleration__ $a$. But how does these quantities related to the __position__ $x$ of the car? And how does the force we apply on the car play in here? And how do these quantities change as a function of time?\n",

Assume you are starting at $t=0$ from a starting position $x(t=0) = 0~\\text{m}$ and your goal is to cross a distance of $100~\\text{m}$. Let's assume for for now you are moving with constant velocity $v$. In one instance you are moving with a velocity of $v = 10~\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}$. How long will it take you to cross the $100~\\text{m}$?\n",

    "\n",
    "In physics, units are very important and they give you a hint how to compute quantities. In the case above, we have the unit $\\frac{\\text{m}}{\\text{s}}$ and to arrive at a unit of distance in meters $\\text{m}$, we see that we need to multiply with a unit of time in seconds $\\text{s}$:\n",
